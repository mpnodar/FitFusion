        <h4 class = "tutorialHeader">Equipment needed:</h4>

        <p>1. Dumbbells: Choose a weight that challenges you but allows you to maintain proper form. <br>
        2. Exercise bench (optional): You can perform bicep curls standing or seated on a bench.</p>

        </div>

        <div class = "start">
            <h4 class = "tutorialHeader" >Starting Position:</h4>
            <p>1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart. <br>
                2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, arms fully extended down by your sides, palms facing forward. <br>
                3. Alternatively, you can sit on a bench with your back straight and feet flat on the floor, holding the dumbbells with your arms extended downward. <br>
                4. Keep your shoulders back, chest up, and core engaged throughout the exercise to maintain proper posture.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "execution">
            <h4 class = "tutorialHeader">Execution:</h4>
            <p>1. Inhale and brace your core. This will help stabilize your spine. <br>
                2. Exhale and slowly bend your elbows, curling the dumbbells upward towards your shoulders. <br>
                3. Keep your upper arms stationary and elbows close to your body. <br>
                4. Focus on contracting your biceps to lift the weights. <br>
                5. Continue lifting until your forearms are vertical and the dumbbells are close to, or lightly touching, your shoulders. <br>
                6. Hold this position briefly to maximize muscle engagement. <br>
                7. Avoid swinging or using momentum to lift the weights. <br>
                8. Keep the movement controlled and deliberate. <br>
                9 Squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement to maximize muscle contraction.</p>
        </div>

        <div class = "sets">
            <h4 class = "tutorialHeader">Repetition and Sets:</h4>
            <p>1. Aim to perform 8 to 12 repetitions for muscle hypertrophy (growth). <br>
                2. If you're aiming for muscular endurance, you can perform higher repetitions. <br>
                3. Start with 2-3 sets of bicep curls and gradually increase the number of sets as you progress.</p>

    <div class = "start">
        <h4 class = "tutorialHeader" >Starting Position:</h4>
        <p>1. Begin by sitting on a sturdy bench with back support or standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. <br>
           2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height, palms facing forward, elbows bent, and upper arms parallel to the floor. <br> 
           3. Your wrists should be straight, and your core engaged for stability.</p>

    <div class = "execution">
        <h4 class = "tutorialHeader">Execution:</h4>
        <p>
            1. Exhale and press the dumbbells upward until your arms are fully extended overhead. <br>
            2. Keep your wrists straight and avoid locking out your elbows at the top of the movement. <br>
            3. Keep your core engaged and maintain a slight bend in your knees to stabilize your body. <br>
            4. Ensure that the dumbbells move in a straight vertical line above your head without leaning forward or backward. This will help target your shoulder muscles effectively.
