                <p>1. Dumbbells: Choose a weight that challenges you but allows you to maintain proper form. <br>
                2. Exercise bench.</p>

                <div class = "start">
                    <h4 class = "tutorialHeader" >Starting Position:</h4>
                    <p>1. Begin by lying flat on a bench with your feet planted firmly on the floor. Ensure your back, shoulders, and head are in contact with the bench throughout the exercise. <br>
                        2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing away from you and your elbows bent at a 90-degree angle. Your upper arms should be parallel to the floor, and your forearms perpendicular to the floor. This is the starting position.</p>

                    <p>
                        1. Exhale and press the dumbbells upward until your arms are fully extended above your chest. <br>
                        2. Keep your wrists straight and avoid locking out your elbows at the top of the movement. <br>
                        3. Focus on pushing the dumbbells upward using the strength of your chest muscles. Imagine squeezing your chest together as you push the weights upward.

                    <h4 class = "tutorialHeader">Repetition and Sets:</h4>
                    <p>1. Aim to perform 8 to 12 repetitions for muscle hypertrophy (growth). <br>
                        2. If you're aiming for muscular endurance, you can perform higher repetitions. <br>
                        3. Start with 2-3 sets of bicep curls and gradually increase the number of sets as you progress.</p>

                <p>1. Dumbbells: Choose a weight that challenges you but allows you to maintain proper form. <br>
                2. Exercise bench (optional): You can perform shoulder press standing or seated on a bench.</p>

            <div class = "start">
                <h4 class = "tutorialHeader" >Starting Position:</h4>
                <p>1. Begin by sitting on a sturdy bench with back support or standing with your feet shoulder-width apart. <br>
                   2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand at shoulder height, palms facing forward, elbows bent, and upper arms parallel to the floor. <br> 
                   3. Your wrists should be straight, and your core engaged for stability.</p>

                <p>
                    1. Exhale and press the dumbbells upward until your arms are fully extended overhead. <br>
                    2. Keep your wrists straight and avoid locking out your elbows at the top of the movement. <br>
                    3. Keep your core engaged and maintain a slight bend in your knees to stabilize your body. <br>
                    4. Ensure that the dumbbells move in a straight vertical line above your head without leaning forward or backward. This will help target your shoulder muscles effectively.

                    2. Adjust the weight of the dumbbells as needed to challenge your chest muscles within the target rep range. <br>
                    3. Start with 2-3 sets of chest presses and gradually increase the number of sets as you progress.</p>

                      <p>1. Stand between parallel bars or use dip bars. <br>
                        2. Grip the bars with your palms facing inward (toward your body) and your arms fully extended. <br>

                            <p>1. Inhale and lower your body by bending your elbows until your shoulders are below your elbows or you feel a stretch in your chest muscles. Keep your elbows pointing slightly backward rather than directly to the sides. <br>
                            2. Keep your torso upright, chest up, and shoulders down and back throughout the movement. <br>
                            3. Lower yourself until your upper arms are parallel to the ground or slightly below, feeling a stretch in your chest muscles. </p>

                        <p>At the bottom of the movement, your chest should be stretched, and your shoulders should be lower than your elbows. Focus on maintaining tension in your chest muscles.</p>

                            <p>1. Aim to perform 8 to 12 repetitions for muscle hypertrophy (growth). Adjust the difficulty of the exercise by using a dip belt with added weight or using assisted dip machines. <br>
                                2. Start with 2-3 sets of chest dips and gradually increase the number of sets as you progress.</p>
