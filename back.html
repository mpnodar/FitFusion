                <p>1. Dumbbells: Choose a weight that challenges you but allows you to maintain proper form. <br>
                2. Exercise bench.</p>

                    <h4 class = "tutorialHeader" >Starting Position:</h4>
                    <p>1. Sit on a lat pulldown machine and adjust the thigh pad so that it fits snugly over your thighs to secure your body in place. <br>
                        2. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip (palms facing away from you) slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Ensure your grip is secure and your wrists are straight.</p>

                    <p>
                        1. Inhale and pull the bar down toward your chest by engaging your lats and pulling your shoulder blades down and back. Keep your elbows pointed outward and your chest lifted throughout the movement. <br>
                        2. Bring the bar down until it touches your upper chest or comes close to touching, depending on your range of motion and flexibility. <br>
                        3. Focus on squeezing your back muscles, particularly your lats, as you bring the bar down.

                    <p>At the bottom of the movement, your chest should be lifted, and the bar should be close to touching your upper chest. Your elbows should be pointing outward, and your back muscles should be fully engaged.</p>

                    <h4 class = "tutorialHeader">Repetition and Sets:</h4>
                    <p>1. Aim to perform 8 to 12 repetitions for muscle hypertrophy (growth), using a weight that challenges your back muscles within the target rep range. <br>
                        2. Start with 2-3 sets of cable lat pulldowns and gradually increase the number of sets as you progress.</p>

                <p>1. Stand facing a cable machine with a straight bar attached to the low pulley. Adjust the weight on the machine to an appropriate level for your fitness level. <br>
                    2. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip (palms facing down) slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Keep your arms fully extended, and your knees slightly bent for stability.</p>

                    1. Inhale and pull the bar towards your lower abdomen by retracting your shoulder blades and bending your elbows. Keep your elbows close to your body and your wrists straight throughout the movement. </p>
                    2. Focus on squeezing your back muscles, particularly your lats, as you pull the bar towards you. Keep your chest lifted and your torso upright throughout the movement.

                <h4 class = "tutorialHeader">Middle Position:</h4>
                <p>At the midpoint of the movement, the bar should be close to your lower abdomen, and your elbows should be bent at approximately 90 degrees. Your back muscles should be fully engaged, and your chest should be lifted.</p>

                      <p>1. Adjust the seat height of the reverse fly machine so that the handles are at shoulder level when seated. <br>
                        2. Sit on the machine with your chest against the pad and your feet flat on the floor. Grasp the handles with an overhand grip (palms facing each other) and keep your arms fully extended in front of you.</p>

                            <p>1. Inhale and squeeze your shoulder blades together as you pull the handles outward and upward in a reverse arc motion. Keep your elbows slightly bent throughout the movement. <br>
                                2. Focus on using your rear deltoids (muscles of the back of the shoulder) to lift the handles, rather than relying on momentum or swinging.</p>
